\def\Abstract{%
Destructible environment has become very popular in computer games, and the demands on realism and therefore efficiency is rising. Currently used game engines use multiple different approaches to create a destructible environment. This thesis studies those approaches and related research and then uses the findings to design another approach to the destructible environment. Our approach relies on using boolean operations on triangular meshes to modify rigid body objects. We implement a simple application to prove that our design can indeed work in the real-time environment, given the input in the set constraints. Our findings are that the approach used can be implemented in computer games featuring low-polygon meshes.
