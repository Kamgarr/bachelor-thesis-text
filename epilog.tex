This thesis managed to satisfy all the goals it set out to accomplish. We researched techniques for creating destructible environment in computer games and methods used for more precise simulations. We also read through the proposed algorithms to create a better approach to the task. We used the knowledge from those sources and designed our own approach.

We limited our approach to the destruction of rigid objects. Our solutions works on the principle of using boolean operations on meshes to create new and more damaged objects.
