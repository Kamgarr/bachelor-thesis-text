This thesis managed to satisfy all the goals it set out to accomplish. We analysed techniques for creating destructible environment used in computer games and methods applicable to precise simulations. Our study of techniques also covered recent scientific papers. The acquired knowledge from those sources helped us to designed our own approach. To support the implementation, we took a look at a selection of libraries providing useful features for  implementing a game with destructible environment.

Our designed algorithm works on the principle of using boolean operations on closed triangular meshes. We limited the simulation to rigid bodies. The result of boolean operations are new and more damaged objects. The most complex problem we encountered in the process of implementing our design is a convex decomposition needed for correct collision detection. To solve this problem we decided to deploy Horizontal Approximate Convex Decomposition algorithm.

The used approximation algorithm for the convex decomposition has shown a few imperfections. In dull objects, the generated decomposition can reach far enough to an empty space that it blocks our vehicle from flying into them. We have also shown that algorithms complexity is directly dependent on the number of triangles in the mesh and grows quickly. Both liabilities make this algorithm only suitable for the games with low polygon objects with simple, almost convex shapes.
